# Sales-Performance-Dashboard


Project Overview

The Sales Performance Dashboard is a comprehensive data visualization tool built using Power BI and SQL. The purpose of the dashboard is to track, analyze, and display key sales performance metrics across different regions, products, and time periods. It helps stakeholders monitor sales trends, identify high-performing areas, and make data-driven decisions to optimize sales strategies.

Features

1. Interactive Visualizations:

-> Multiple Power BI charts, graphs, and tables for sales performance.

-> Visual breakdown of sales by region, product, and sales representative.

-> Time-based filters (year, quarter, month) for granular data analysis.

2. KPI Tracking:

-> Key metrics such as Total Sales, Profit Margin, Sales Growth Rate, and Top-Performing Products.

-> Comparison against sales targets and historical data.

3. SQL-Driven Data:

-> SQL queries used to extract and transform data from the database.

-> Real-time or scheduled data refresh for up-to-date insights.

4. Customizable Filters:

-> Filter sales data by region, product category, or salesperson.

-> Ability to drill down into specific product or region-level performance.

5. Automated Reports:

-> Power BI's ability to export reports in PDF or email format.

-> Schedule daily, weekly, or monthly reports for different stakeholders.


Technology Stack:

-> Power BI: For data visualization and interactive dashboard creation.

-> SQL: For data extraction, transformation, and loading (ETL) from the sales database.

-> Data Source: Sales data stored in a relational database (e.g., SQL Server or MySQL).

Setup Instructions:

Prerequisites:

-> Power BI Desktop: Ensure that Power BI Desktop is installed.

-> Database Access: Ensure access to the sales database via SQL queries.

-> SQL Server/Database: (optional) Install SQL Server or have access to an existing SQL database.


Step 1: SQL Queries for Data Extraction

Use the following SQL queries to extract data such as sales transactions, products, regions, and sales targets. Modify the query as needed for your specific database schema:
l
SELECT 
    Sales.Date,
    Sales.Amount,
    Sales.ProductID,
    Product.ProductName,
    Region.RegionName,
    SalesRep.RepName
FROM 
    Sales
INNER JOIN 
    Product ON Sales.ProductID = Product.ProductID
INNER JOIN 
    Region ON Sales.RegionID = Region.RegionID
INNER JOIN 
    SalesRep ON Sales.RepID = SalesRep.RepID
WHERE 
    Sales.Date >= '2023-01-01';  -- Modify as needed


Step 2: Data Import into Power BI

-> Open Power BI Desktop.

-> Select Get Data → SQL Server (or the relevant data source).

-> Enter your SQL Server credentials and paste the SQL query to fetch the required data.

-> Load the data into Power BI.


Step 3: Data Model Setup

-> In Power BI, ensure the correct relationships between tables (e.g., between Sales, Products, Regions, Sales Representatives).

-> Create Calculated Columns and Measures for metrics like Total Sales, Profit Margin, and Sales Growth.


Step 4: Building Visualizations

-> Use Bar Charts, Line Charts, Tables, and Maps to visualize sales by product, region, and time.

-> Add KPIs for tracking overall sales, profit, and targets.

-> Implement Filters and Slicers for dynamic data exploration.


Step 5: Configure Report Automation

-> In Power BI, go to File → Publish to Power BI Service.

-> Set up Scheduled Data Refresh to automatically update the dashboard with the latest sales data.

-> Use Power BI Service to configure report distribution or export PDFs.


Usage

-> Open the Power BI dashboard and use the slicers (filters) to explore sales data by region, product, and time period.

-> Review KPIs to track overall sales performance and identify trends.

-> Use drill-down capabilities to analyze sales by individual sales representatives or products.


Future Enhancements

-> Integrating predictive analytics for forecasting sales trends.

-> Adding more detailed sales target comparisons for specific regions and products.
Including customer feedback or satisfaction metrics to align with sales performance.
